Attributes in HTML provide additional information about HTML elements. 
They are always included in the opening tag and usually come in name/value pairs like: name="value".

Example:
<a href="https://www.example.com" target="_blank">Visit Example</a>
Here, 'href' and 'target' are attributes of the <a> tag.
