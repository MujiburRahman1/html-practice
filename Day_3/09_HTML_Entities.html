    <h1>HTML Entities</h1>
    <ul>
        <li>An html entity is a piece of text ("stirng") that begins with an ampersand (&) and ends with a semicolon (;).</li>
        <li>Used to display resereved characters (which would otherwise be interpreted as HTML code), and invisibel characters (like non-breaking spaces).</li>
        <li>Can also use in place of characters that are difficult to type with a standard keyboard.</li>
        <li>Browser interprets them & renders correct character</li>
        <li>Example: &lt; will be displayed as &lt; in the browser</li>
        <li>HTML entities are used to represent characters that have special meaning in HTML, such as <, >, &, ", and '.</li>
        <li>They are also used to represent characters that may not be easily typed on a keyboard, such as non-breaking spaces or special symbols.</li>
        <li>HTML entities are written as an ampersand (&) followed by the entity name or number, and ending with a semicolon (;).</li>
        <li>For example, the HTML entity for the less than symbol (<) is &lt;, and for the greater than symbol (>) is &gt;.</li>
        <li>Using HTML entities helps ensure that the content is displayed correctly in web browsers and prevents any confusion with HTML tags.</li>
